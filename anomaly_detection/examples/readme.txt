Getting started examples of neural networks using Keras/Tensorflow in R
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how to upload and run Kaggle Notebooks containing examples of how to program neural networks
for regression and classification using Keras/Tensorflow from R.


1. Go to www.Kaggle.com
2. Click "Code" (left panel)
3. Click "+ New Notebook"
4. Open the Settings sidebar (click in the "K" icon in the top-right), and select language R.
5. Enable the internet option.

	You need to do this just once.
	Click "Internet Requires phone verification"
	Follow instructions to get a verification code sent to your phone.
	Apply that code to get an internet slider in Settings, and use that to enable the internet option.

6. Choose:  File / Upload Notebook / Browse Files
   Select the Notebook file (*.irnb) and click "Open" then "Upload"
7. Click in the notebook name textbox, (top-left above the menu items, something like: "notebookxxxx"), 
   and give the new notebook a name.
8. Click on each cell in turn to make it active and run it.
9. If you want to save the notebook outputs, click "Save Version" (blue box) to do a "quick save".
